Generative AI Use Case:

Set up and Generative Configuration:

1 - Set up Kernel and Required Dependencies

2 - Prompt Engineering

3 - Instruction Prompt

4 - One Shot and Few Shot Inference

5 - Generative Configuration Parameters for Inference

Fine-Tune a Generative AI Model:

1 - Set up Kernel, Load Required Dependencies, Dataset and LLM

2 - reprocess the Dataset, Perform Full Fine-Tuning, and Evaluate the Model with the ROUGE Metric

3 - Perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA Model)

Fine-tune with Reinforcement Learning (PPO) and PEFT to Generate Less-Toxic Summaries:

1 - Set up Kernel and Required Dependencies

2 - Load FLAN-T5 Model, Prepare Reward Model and Toxicity Evaluator

3 - Perform Fine-Tuning to Detoxify the Summaries and Evaluate the Model
